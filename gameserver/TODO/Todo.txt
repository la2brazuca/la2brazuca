0) New Build Files to allow simple compilation and local copy to test the server locally. OK
1) Refactoring of L2jScoria to L2jFrozen. OK
2) Check of Configuration Files and Translation into English:
	a) Translate all the configuration files into English
	b) Check if all configuration parameters are correctly described
	c) Check that all configuration parameters are effectively used and used correctly
	
3) Check of Main Admin Features:
    x) Let's make a command to show all "Avaible" Commands into the admin command pannel
	a) If it's needed a command to allow to start/stop an Event/Operation manually, let's do it
	b) If something in existent commands is wrong, let's check and fix it
	c) Check that each admin command has its needed access level into a configuration file to
	   allow the creation of specified GMs with particular rights
	   
4) Core Extentions and Fixes:
	a) New Balance Classes System needed:
		a) it must contain each class and damage multiplayer against each class (this is the only way
		   to really balance completely the game as we want
		b) it must contain each effect (stun, sleep, etc..) chance multiplayer and be sure that it works properly
	
	b) EPIC Raid Bosses System must be substituted or fixed (I suggest to substitute it with last l2jFree or L2jServer
	   version because the main bosses are always the same)
	   
	c) Quests: someone say that L2Scoria quest engine doesn't work properly, it must be verified by players
	   and if something is wrong we could substitute with l2jteon or other.  
	   
	   
BUGS and Petitions:

Bluff doesn't enter
TvT Potions not allowed, but they work (maybe because the potion here is as a skill...)
