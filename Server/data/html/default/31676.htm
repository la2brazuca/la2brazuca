Commander of the Border Patrol, Gregory Athebaldt:
<br>
I'm Gregory Athebaldt, commander of the border patrol of Aden kingdom.
<br>
Currently, the forces of both countries are massing near the border. 
Although the border is open, the tension between the countries has resurfaced. 
You'd better watch your back, my friend!
